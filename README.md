# Sorting_Visualizer
Sorting is the process of arranging elements either in ascending order or descending order. We often fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm because we are unable to visualise how they work. Visualisation can motivate the students to learn and understand easily without any difficulty.




# This is how our Sorting Visualizer looks like...
All the buttons have hover effect. we can also detect the size and speed of the bars.
